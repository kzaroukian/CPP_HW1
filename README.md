Homework for CIS 343

Both kzaroukian and zaroukik are my accounts, I had my school email attached to my kzaroukian account but then moved it to my zaroukik account. I realized that this changed the contributor to my repositories so I reattached my school email to my kzaroukian account but it is still showing as 2 contributors, just so you know why it says "2 contributors". It is really is just me!
